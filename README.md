# Custom Tag Badge Chooser
As per [this question on Meta SO](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/382516/8828658), it is possible to customize tag badges.
[Xufox] [suggested a way to accomplish this](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/382517/8828658), but that's quite a bit of work
and monkeying around in the developer tools. I wanted a fast, easy, and GUI-based way to change my tag badge to something
spicy.

So naturally, I made a userscript.
